# Sorting-Techniques
Sort techniques to make work easy

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort algorithm where first value is compared with the second.
If second value is less than first , swap the values
If not, no swap required
Two loops we have to maintain
First Loop :: do while :: Using swapped flag to loop the array
Second Loop :: for loop ( Zero index - Less than array length) :: 
If condition is true, swap the values and update swapped flag value else swapped flag will be false 

## Selection Sort 
We find min index value from an array and compare it with first item
Swap the values
This process goes excluding the first item ( because it's in correct position) each time during traverse of an array 
Two loops required
First :: for swapping 
Second :: for updating min index value

## Insertion Sort
we insert item by swap it with cuurent value

## Merge Sort
Divide and Conqueror Algorithm


## Quick Sort
Using one of the Divide and Conqueror algorithm Quick Sort.
We have to choose any pivot element thorugh this we keep value less than to left side and greater than to right side 
Using recursion will follow this until sorted
